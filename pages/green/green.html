        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Green smoothies are <em>irreplacable</em> in my opinion. They're great for getting a healthy serving or two <br>
               first thing in the morning. Gone are the days of endless salads to fill your daily quota of greens. A tasty <br>
               green smoothie makes it so much easier and enjoyable to get that healthy dose of vitamins and minerals.
            </p>

            <p>This recipe is so easy and only a handful of ingredients making this the perfect morning smoothie <br>
               to start the day!
