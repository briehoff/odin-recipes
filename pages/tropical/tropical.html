    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Smoothies are the language of summer! Seriously, who doesn't equate fruity drinks with the <br>
           warmest, sunniest, and fun-filled time of the year?
        </p>

        <p>This tropical smoothie will send you on a one-way trip to Hawaii and have you saying <em>Aloha!</em><br>
           The pineapple is what really sends it. Try the original recipe and then play around with the <br>
           proportions to suit your pallate.</p>
