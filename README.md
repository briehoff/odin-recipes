In this project I was tasked with creating a recipe website. This required me to set up html documents for each page and structure content with in the <body> tags for the purpose of sharing information in a visual way. I utilized <p> tags for text, <ul> and <ol> tags for ingredient lists and steps lists. I also added images through absolute links and linked all my recipe pages to the home page. 

Once HTML was in place, I add style using CSS.
